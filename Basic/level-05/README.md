# Level 5

## Question

Sam has gotten wise to all the people who wrote their own forms to get the
password. Rather than actually learn the password, he decided to make his email
program a little more secure.

## Explanation

```html
<form action="/missions/basic/5/level5.php" method="post">
    <input type="hidden" name="to" value="sam@hackthissite.org">
    <input type="submit" value="Send password to Sam">
</form>
```

## Solution

The Question is same as the previous one, changeing the email address will send
you the password.
