## Question

Often times you will need to decipher a language which you can not find on
GOOGLE, or is encrypted in some way

I have made up a language for you to decipher. What is the output of this
program?

```pascal
BEGIN notr.eal
CREATE int AS 2
DESTROY int AS 0
ANS var AS Create + TO
out TO
```

## Explanation

The goal is to guess how a new language works. The language is a simple
language.

```pascal
BEGIN notr.eal          // This is the start of the program
CREATE int AS 2         // This creates a variable named `CREATE` and assigns it the value 2
DESTROY int AS 0        // This creates a variable named `DESTROY` and assigns it the value 0
ANS var AS Create + TO  // This creates a variable named `TO` and assigns it the value of `Create + TO`
out TO                 // This prints the value of `TO`
```

## Solution

Now that we know how the language works, we can see that the output of the
program is `2`.

## Answer

```
2
```
