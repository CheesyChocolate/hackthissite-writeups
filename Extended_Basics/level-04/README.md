## Question

Often times you will need to decipher a language which you can not find on
GOOGLE, or is encrypted in some way

I have made up a language for you to decipher. This is slightly harder. What is
the output of this program?

This is a REAL language with REAL rules. This is practice for obfuscation or
encrypted functions.

{user types 6,7}

```pascal
BEGIN F.ake
var int as in
int var as in
out var int
```

## Explanation

Let's break down the code:

```pascal
BEGIN F.ake     // Start of the program
var int as in   // Declare a variable `int` as an integer assigned the vakue of `in` which is 6
int var as in   // Declare a variable `var` as an integer assigned the value of `in` which is 7
out var int     // Output the value of `var` and `int` without any space or character in between
```

## Solution

With said explanation, the output of the program is `67`.

## Answer

```
67
```
